**Genius** â€” A funny and simple Language C game
==================================================

# Description

**Name**: Genius

**Language**: C

**Author**: [Jhonatan Oliveira](http://www.jhonatanoliveira.com.br)

It's a simple C application that simulates the basic structure of a popular game in the 80s and 90s, called 'Genius' in Brazil.

The game 'Genius' is a memory game that has become very popular in Brazil in a toy manufactured by 'Estrela', one of the main toys manufactures of the country and was based on the American version 'Simon'.

There are, actually, many versions of the game in several programming languages, but until this moment, I found out only one version in C language to teach the programming logic in a simple game, but I missed it. It was my ex-teacher's version. Due to its problem, I rewrote in a basic idea, but not following all the best programming practices in the beginning.

If you want to change or use a base of the code, feel free!!

Thank you!
